  /**
   * This class encapsulates input files independent of their format.
   *
   * Objects of this class read the content of a file and grant access to it. The input is not
   * yet interpreted in any way. Input files contain different sections. The content can be matched
   * against an expected InputSpec via match_section() to extract meaningful data.
   *
   * Sections may appear in an arbitrary order and each section name must be unique. An exception is
   * the special section named "INCLUDES" which can contain a list of other files that should be
   * read in addition to the current file.
   *
   * Three file formats are supported: the custom .dat file format and the standard .yaml (or .yml)
   * and .json formats. The format of a file is detected based on its ending. If the ending is not
   * one of the above-mentioned, the file is assumed to be in the .dat format.
   * Included files do not have to use the same format as the including file.
   *
   * The following example shows the structure of a .dat file:
   *
   * @code
   * // A comment. Sections start with at least two dashes in the .dat file format.
   * --INCLUDES
   * include1.yml
   * include2.json
   * // More dashes are allowed to start a section.
   * -------------SECTION1
   * key1 = value1
   * key2 = value2
   * // The "=" is optional and can be replaced by whitespace. This only works if key and value do
   * // not contain whitespace themselves.
   * key3 value3
   * --SECTION2
   * A line with content that is not a key-value pair. It can contain anything.
   * @endcode
   *
   * A similar example looks like this in .yaml format:
   *
   * @code
   * INCLUDES:
   *   - include1.yml
   *   - include2.json
   * # A comment. Note that sections do NOT start with dashes in the .yaml file format.
   * SECTION1:
   *   key1: value1
   *   key2: value2
   * SECTION2:
   *   - A line with content that is not a key-value pair.
   *   - It can contain anything.
   *   - We call these unstructured sections "legacy sections".
   * @endcode
   *
   *
   * @note The file is only read on rank 0 to save memory. All sections are broadcast to all other
   * ranks, except for the legacy sections (see the constructor). Legacy sections need to be
   * consumed on rank 0 with the help of in_section_rank_0_only().
