  /** @brief Write output for each Newton step during one load step in
   *  an extra output file.
   *
   *  This class is designed for debugging purposes only. The corresponding
   *  input parameters are summarized in the section "---IO/EVERY ITERATION".
   *  The implementation is meant to work as plug-in solution for all kinds of
   *  problems. Anyway, the first implemented use can be found in the structural
   *  time integration, such that it can be seen as a blue print.
   *
   *  In general, if you consider to use this class, you will have to construct
   *  an object and call init() and setup() in consecutive order. Pass the
   *  output-writer of your problem to the init() function. This output
   *  writer will be copied, such that the every iteration output should generate
   *  the same output each Newton step just as the parent writer does in each
   *  time/load step.
   *
   *  Secondly, you have to give this class access to your Output routines.
   *  All methods which have to be accessed are summarized in the
   *  EveryIterationWriterInterface class. Just add the abstract interface class
   *  as base to your inheritance hierarchy of the class which contains these
   *  functions. See Solid::TimeInt::Base for an example.
   *
   *  Finally, such that the output is actually written you have to call the
   *  public class methods at the correct point in your implementation.
   *  The method InitNewtonIteration() should be called before you enter your
   *  Newton loop. AddNewtonIteration is supposed to be called just in the end
   *  of each Newton iteration.
   *
   *  You can find your every iteration output in an extra directory located in
   *  your specified output folder. For example: If your output path is
   *  "../o/fancy_sim", the every iteration output is written to
   *  "../o/fancy_sim_every_iter/fancy_sim_step_<CURRENT_STEP_NUMBER>". Each
   *  step gets an extra control, result and mesh file. It is also possible to
   *  restrict the output to one single time/load step. If you perform different
   *  runs of the same simulation and the same load/time step, just use the
   *  input parameter RUN_NUMBER. If a positive number is provided the result of
   *  each run can be found in the directory
   *
   *            "../o/fancy_sim_every_iter/run_<RUN_NUMBER>/".
   *
   *  Finally, a short note related to restarted steps: Think of a scenario
   *  where you want to restart step 2 of your simulation "fancy_sim" and you
   *  want to write the corresponding Newton iteration output as well. In this
   *  case the directory path stays untouched, while the final file name is
   *  extended by the restart counter number. Therefore, in the first restart
   *  run the entire path will be
   *
   *      "../o/fancy_sim_every_iter/run_<RUN_NUMBER>/fancy_sim-1_step_2".
   *
   *  This makes sense since you will not overwrite any previous (debugging)
   *  results which were generated by a possible completely different head file.
   *
   *  For more information see the mentioned input section.
   *
   *  That's all. I hope this will help you to find some nasty bugs.
