  \brief A class to manage a discretization in parallel

  A discretization describes a discretized physical domain including any
  boundary conditions. This is a huge concept that includes four different parts:

  - a mesh consisting of elements and nodes
  - a number of sets of degrees of freedom (dofsets)
  - conditions that point to nodes (nodal clouds) but really mean dofs
  - state vectors that belong to one of the dofsets

  <h3>Parallelization</h3>

  A huge point with the discretization is its parallel distribution. In normal
  circumstances each processor will hole a slice of the distribution. There will
  be some overlapping elements. This is known as ghosting as all elements belong
  to exactly one processor and may appear as ghosts (guests) on other processors
  as well.

  The parallel distribution is handled via Epetra_Map objects. There are
  row-maps that are unique without any overlap. There are column-maps that
  extend the row-maps with the overlap information. Elements, nodes and dofs are
  managed by using maps. That is all three items have a globally unique id,
  oftentimes called gid. Global ids are arbitrary numbers. Apart from the fact
  that these numbers are unique there comes no guarantee whatsoever with these
  numbers. You must never use the numerical value of a gid.

  In addition to the gids there are local ids, called lids. These are always
  consecutive numbers starting from 0. Local ids just count local items. See
  Epetra_Map for details.

  <h3>Initialization</h3>

  The initialization of a discretization is a major effort since the parallel
  distribution needs to be established. Normally the discretization is read from
  an input file with the help of Discret::InputFile and related classes. The
  discretization class comes with a bunch of helper method for its setup phase.

  <h3>Filled-State</h3>

  A discretization can be in its filled or non-filled state. After construction
  a discretization starts in its non-filled state. In the non-filled state there
  are no lids calculated yet. The discretization is not fit for any calculation.

  A call for fill_complete() fills the discretization, that is brings it to its
  filled state. Now all lids are available. See below for details.

  <h3>DofSets</h3>

  A discretization can have multiple dof sets. At construction time the first
  DofSet is created. Further dof sets can be added later on.

  The first DofSet is always special as it describes the set of unknowns of this
  discretization. These are the values that are to be calculated later
  on. Additional dof sets can describe additional sets of variables that
  supplement the calculation. In normal single field calculations only one
  DofSet is needed.

  For multifield calculations with volume coupled fully overlapping matching
  discretizations that share the same parallel distribution (that is different
  fields that are discretized with the same mesh -- a rather special case that
  turns out to be quite common) there is the DofSetProxy class that can be used
  to introduce the DofSet of the respective other field.

    \brief Evaluate Dirichlet boundary conditions

    Loop all Dirichlet conditions attached to the discretization and evaluate them.
    This method considers all conditions in condition_ with the names
    "PointDirichlet", "LineDirichlet", "SurfaceDirichlet" and "VolumeDirichlet".
    It takes a current time from the parameter list params named "total time"
    and evaluates the appropriate time curves at that time for each
    Dirichlet condition separately. If "total time" is not included
    in the parameters, no time curves are used.

    \note Opposed to the other 'Evaluate' method does this one NOT assembly but
          OVERWRITE values in the output vector systemvector. For this reason,
          dirichlet boundary conditions are evaluated in the following order:
          First "VolumeDirichlet", then "SurfaceDirichlet", then "LineDirichlet"
          and finally "PointDirichlet". This way, the lower entity dirichlet BCs override
          the higher ones and a point Dirichlet BCs has priority over other dirichlet
          BCs in the input file.

    Parameters recognized by this method:
    \code
    params.set("total time",acttime); // current total time
    \endcode
